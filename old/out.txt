When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these molecules and is scattered in all directions. The blue wavelengths of light scatter more than other wavelengths, which is why we see the sky as blue.","done":true,"total_duration":9720174740,"load_duration":1402398,"prompt_eval_count":6,"prompt_eval_duration":620686000,"eval_count":58,"eval_duration":9053932000}{"model":"codegemma","created_at":"2024-05-07T00:54:51.55728107Z","response":"\n\nThe blue light of sunlight scatters more effectively than longer wavelengths of light, such as red light. This scattering is caused by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, particularly nitrogen and oxygen. When sunlight interacts with these molecules, it is bent and separated into its different wavelengths. The blue light is scattered more strongly than the longer wavelengths, such as red light, because it scatters more effectively. As a result, we see the sky as blue.","done":true,"total_duration":20584565076,"load_duration":4125611734,"prompt_eval_count":7,"prompt_eval_duration":439015000,"eval_count":92,"eval_duration":15978738000}
